# hello-world-cljs

This repo is a checkin of running through the [ClojureScript Quick
Start](https://clojurescript.org/guides/quick-start) guide plus a few
bonuses. The instructions for building a Node app were followed.

A Makefile with the following targets was written:

* `run`: build and run the app
* `build`: just build the app
* `repl`: run a REPL
* `clean`: clean up autogenerated files
